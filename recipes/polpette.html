    <h3>Polpette (Italian Meatballs)</h3>
    <p>These tasty Italian meatballs (polpette) start off in the oven, and finish by simmering in a simple tomato sauce. We love them as a main dish, with a side of sautéed zucchini and a salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground sweet Italian pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2/3 cup minced shallot</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (see Note)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 (24-ounce) jars tomato puree</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>vCombine sausage, ground beef, shallot, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground meat and roughly mix ingredients together. Stir in beaten eggs, milk, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix all ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Pour water into a shallow bowl, and moisten fingertips and palms with water. Shape meatball mixture into about 40 ping-pong sized balls and place on the prepared sheet pan. When fingers become sticky, dip them in water.</li>
        <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a bit underdone in the center, about 20 minutes. If meatballs are larger, adjust baking time.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato purée into a large sauce pot or a Dutch oven set over medium-low heat. Stir in minced garlic and Italian herbs. Sample the sauce for seasoning, and adjust, if needed.</li>
        <li>When sauce begins to bubble slightly, add meatballs and stir gently, coating all the meatballs with sauce. Keep meatballs and sauce at a low simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, place meatballs and sauce on a plate, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
