                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Add leek and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5
                            minutes. Add rice and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,
                            uncovered, for 5 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. Pour in remaining chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium and
                            cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid is almost absorbed and seafood has
                            cooked, about 5 minutes. When rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.
